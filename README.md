# Random-Stuff

Some of my small beginner projects

stvorce.html - my first attempt at animation of JS - randommly placed squared with random colours

titulky.html - I tried to simulate fade ins and fade out titles in a beginning of a movie. Hardcoded timing

todoweb.html - simple TO DO app - not useful and would be much better if coded with some framework such as React. 
It required quite a lot of googling and stack overflow
